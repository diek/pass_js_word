## Synopsis

Use Flask to pass data from Flask app to Javascript file and load the options for a form select. Display selected item on page.


## Motivation
### diek's missing step 2.
I searched several times for a simple example of using a passing list data from Flask to Javascript. This small app fills part of the gap between "hello world" - step 1 and the official Flask 'flaskr' example - step 3, imho.
This is very basic example of using Flask to manipulate the DOM via Javascript.

## Installation  

- Use virtualenv + virtualwrapper to create a virtual environment for your Flask project. If this is unfamiliar I suggest going here. <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to Python: Virtual Environments</a>
- `$:pip install r- requirements.txt`
-  bootstrap is used to 'pretty' it up.


## Tests

Yes, important. This is step 2, tests happen later ... check out the crew @ Real Python's example <a href="https://realpython.com/blog/python/the-minimum-viable-test-suite/">Minimum Viable Test Suite</a>
